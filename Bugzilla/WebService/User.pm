=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::Webservice::User - The User Account and Login API

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This part of the Bugzilla API allows you to create User Accounts and
log in/out using an existing account.

=head1 METHODS

See L<Bugzilla::WebService> for a description of how parameters are passed,
and what B<STABLE>, B<UNSTABLE>, and B<EXPERIMENTAL> mean.

=head1 Logging In and Out

=head2 login

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Logging in, with a username and password, is required for many
Bugzilla installations, in order to search for bugs, post new bugs,
etc. This method logs in an user.

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<login> (string) - The user's login name. 

=item C<password> (string) - The user's password.

=item C<remember> (bool) B<Optional> - if the cookies returned by the
call to login should expire with the session or not.  In order for
this option to have effect the Bugzilla server must be configured to
allow the user to set this option - the Bugzilla parameter
I<rememberlogin> must be set to "defaulton" or
"defaultoff". Addionally, the client application must implement
management of cookies across sessions.

=back

=item B<Returns>

On success, a hash containing one item, C<id>, the numeric id of the
user that was logged in.  A set of http cookies is also sent with the
response.  These cookies must be sent along with any future requests
to the webservice, for the duration of the session.

=item B<Errors>

=over

=item 300 (Invalid Username or Password)

The username does not exist, or the password is wrong.

=item 301 (Account Disabled)

The account has been disabled.  A reason may be specified with the
error.

=item 305 (New Password Required)

The current password is correct, but the user is asked to change
his password.

=item 50 (Param Required)

A login or password parameter was not provided.

=back

=back

=head2 logout

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Log out the user. Does nothing if there is no user logged in.

=item B<Params> (none)

=item B<Returns> (nothing)

=item B<Errors> (none)

=back

=head1 Account Creation

=head2 offer_account_by_email

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Sends an email to the user, offering to create an account.  The user
will have to click on a URL in the email, and choose their password
and real name.

This is the recommended way to create a Bugzilla account.

=item B<Param>

=over

=item C<email> (string) - the email to send the offer to.

=back

=item B<Returns> (nothing)

=item B<Errors>

=over

=item 500 (Account Already Exists)

An account with that email address already exists in Bugzilla.

=item 501 (Illegal Email Address)

This Bugzilla does not allow you to create accounts with the format of
email address you specified. Account creation may be entirely disabled.

=back

=back

=head2 create

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Creates a user account directly in Bugzilla, password and all.
Instead of this, you should use L</offer_account_by_email> when
possible, because that makes sure that the email address specified can
actually receive an email. This function does not check that.

You must be logged in and have the C<editusers> privilege in order to
call this function.

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<email> (string) - The email address for the new user.

=item C<full_name> (string) B<Optional> - The user's full name. Will
be set to empty if not specified.

=item C<password> (string) B<Optional> - The password for the new user
account, in plain text.  It will be stripped of leading and trailing
whitespace.  If blank or not specified, the newly created account will
exist in Bugzilla, but will not be allowed to log in using DB
authentication until a password is set either by the user (through
resetting their password) or by the administrator.

=back

=item B<Returns>

A hash containing one item, C<id>, the numeric id of the user that was
created.

=item B<Errors>

The same as L</offer_account_by_email>. If a password is specified,
the function may also throw:

=over

=item 502 (Password Too Short)

The password specified is too short. (Usually, this means the
password is under three characters.)

=back

=item B<History>

=over

=item Error 503 (Password Too Long) removed in Bugzilla B<3.6>.

=back

=back

=head1 User Info

=head2 get

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Gets information about user accounts in Bugzilla.

=item B<Params>

B<Note>: At least one of C<ids>, C<names>, or C<match> must be specified.

B<Note>: Users will not be returned more than once, so even if a user 
is matched by more than one argument, only one user will be returned.

In addition to the parameters below, this method also accepts the
standard L<include_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/include_fields> and
L<exclude_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/exclude_fields> arguments.

=over

=item C<ids> (array) 

An array of integers, representing user ids.

Logged-out users cannot pass this parameter to this function. If they try,
they will get an error. Logged-in users will get an error if they specify
the id of a user they cannot see.

=item C<names> (array)

An array of login names (strings).

=item C<match> (array)

An array of strings. This works just like "user matching" in
Bugzilla itself. Users will be returned whose real name or login name
contains any one of the specified strings. Users that you cannot see will
not be included in the returned list.

Some Bugzilla installations have user-matching turned off, in which
case you will only be returned exact matches.

Most installations have a limit on how many matches are returned for
each string, which defaults to 1000 but can be changed by the Bugzilla
administrator.

Logged-out users cannot use this argument, and an error will be thrown
if they try. (This is to make it harder for spammers to harvest email
addresses from Bugzilla, and also to enforce the user visibility
restrictions that are implemented on some Bugzillas.)

=item C<group_ids> (array)

=item C<groups> (array)

C<group_ids> is an array of numeric ids for groups that a user can be in.
C<groups> is an array of names of groups that a user can be in.
If these are specified, they limit the return value to users who are
in I<any> of the groups specified.

=item C<include_disabled> (boolean)

By default, when using the C<match> parameter, disabled users are excluded
from the returned results unless their full username is identical to the
match string. Setting C<include_disabled> to C<true> will include disabled
users in the returned results even if their username doesn't fully match
the input string.

=back

=item B<Returns> 

A hash containing one item, C<users>, that is an array of
hashes. Each hash describes a user, and has the following items:

=over

=item id

C<int> The unique integer ID that Bugzilla uses to represent this user. 
Even if the user's login name changes, this will not change.

=item real_name

C<string> The actual name of the user. May be blank.

=item email

C<string> The email address of the user.

=item name

C<string> The login name of the user. Note that in some situations this is 
different than their email.

=item can_login

C<boolean> A boolean value to indicate if the user can login into bugzilla. 

=item email_enabled

C<boolean> A boolean value to indicate if bug-related mail will be sent
to the user or not.

=item login_denied_text

C<string> A text field that holds the reason for disabling a user from logging
into bugzilla, if empty then the user account is enabled. Otherwise it is 
disabled/closed.

B<Note>: If you are not logged in to Bugzilla when you call this function, you
will only be returned the C<id>, C<name>, and C<real_name> items. If you are
logged in and not in editusers group, you will only be returned the C<id>, C<name>, 
C<real_name>, C<email>, and C<can_login> items.

=back

=item B<Errors>

=over

=item 51 (Bad Login Name or Group Name)

You passed an invalid login name in the "names" array or a bad
group name/id in the C<groups>/C<group_ids> arguments.

=item 304 (Authorization Required)

You are logged in, but you are not authorized to see one of the users you
wanted to get information about by user id.

=item 505 (User Access By Id or User-Matching Denied)

Logged-out users cannot use the "ids" or "match" arguments to this 
function.

=back

=item B<History>

=over

=item Added in Bugzilla B<3.4>.

=item C<group_ids> and C<groups> were added in Bugzilla B<4.0>.

=item C<include_disabled> added in Bugzilla B<4.0>. Default behavior 
for C<match> has changed to only returning enabled accounts.
