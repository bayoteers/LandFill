=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::Webservice::Bug - The API for creating, changing, and getting the
details of bugs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This part of the Bugzilla API allows you to file a new bug in Bugzilla,
or get information about bugs that have already been filed.

=head1 METHODS

See L<Bugzilla::WebService> for a description of how parameters are passed,
and what B<STABLE>, B<UNSTABLE>, and B<EXPERIMENTAL> mean.

=head1 Utility Functions

=head2 fields

B<UNSTABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Get information about valid bug fields, including the lists of legal values
for each field.

=item B<Params>

You can pass either field ids or field names.

B<Note>: If neither C<ids> nor C<names> is specified, then all 
non-obsolete fields will be returned.

In addition to the parameters below, this method also accepts the
standard L<include_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/include_fields> and
L<exclude_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/exclude_fields> arguments.

=over

=item C<ids>   (array) - An array of integer field ids.

=item C<names> (array) - An array of strings representing field names.

=back

=item B<Returns>

A hash containing a single element, C<fields>. This is an array of hashes,
containing the following keys:

=over

=item C<id>

C<int> An integer id uniquely identifying this field in this installation only.

=item C<type>

C<int> The number of the fieldtype. The following values are defined:

=over

=item C<is_custom>

C<boolean> True when this is a custom field, false otherwise.

=item C<name>

C<string> The internal name of this field. This is a unique identifier for
this field. If this is not a custom field, then this name will be the same
across all Bugzilla installations.

=item C<display_name>

C<string> The name of the field, as it is shown in the user interface.

=item C<is_mandatory>

C<boolean> True if the field must have a value when filing new bugs.
Also, mandatory fields cannot have their value cleared when updating
bugs.

=item C<is_on_bug_entry>

C<boolean> For custom fields, this is true if the field is shown when you
enter a new bug. For standard fields, this is currently always false,
even if the field shows up when entering a bug. (To know whether or not
a standard field is valid on bug entry, see L</create>.)

=item C<visibility_field>

C<string>  The name of a field that controls the visibility of this field
in the user interface. This field only appears in the user interface when
the named field is equal to one of the values in C<visibility_values>.
Can be null.

=item C<visibility_values>

C<array> of C<string>s This field is only shown when C<visibility_field>
matches one of these values. When C<visibility_field> is null,
then this is an empty array.

=item C<value_field>

C<string>  The name of the field that controls whether or not particular
values of the field are shown in the user interface. Can be null.

=item C<values>

This is an array of hashes, representing the legal values for
select-type (drop-down and multiple-selection) fields. This is also
populated for the C<component>, C<version>, and C<target_milestone>
fields, but not for the C<product> field (you must use
L<Product.get_accessible_products|Bugzilla::WebService::Product/get_accessible_products>
for that.

For fields that aren't select-type fields, this will simply be an empty
array.

Each hash has the following keys:

=over 

=item C<name>

C<string> The actual value--this is what you would specify for this
field in L</create>, etc.

=item C<sortkey>

C<int> Values, when displayed in a list, are sorted first by this integer
and then secondly by their name.

=item C<visibility_values>

If C<value_field> is defined for this field, then this value is only shown
if the C<value_field> is set to one of the values listed in this array.
Note that for per-product fields, C<value_field> is set to C<'product'>
and C<visibility_values> will reflect which product(s) this value appears in.

=item C<is_open>

C<boolean> For C<bug_status> values, determines whether this status
specifies that the bug is "open" (true) or "closed" (false). This item
is only included for the C<bug_status> field.

=item C<can_change_to>

For C<bug_status> values, this is an array of hashes that determines which
statuses you can transition to from this status. (This item is only included
for the C<bug_status> field.)

Each hash contains the following items:

=over

=item C<name>

the name of the new status

=item C<comment_required>

this C<boolean> True if a comment is required when you change a bug into
this status using this transition.

=head1 Bug Information

=head2 attachments

B<EXPERIMENTAL>

=over

=item B<Description>

It allows you to get data about attachments, given a list of bugs
and/or attachment ids.

B<Note>: Private attachments will only be returned if you are in the 
insidergroup or if you are the submitter of the attachment.

=item B<Params>

B<Note>: At least one of C<ids> or C<attachment_ids> is required.

=over

=item C<ids>

See the description of the C<ids> parameter in the L</get> method.

=item C<attachment_ids>

C<array> An array of integer attachment ids.

=back

Also accepts the L<include_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/include_fields>,
and L<exclude_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/exclude_fields> arguments.

=item B<Returns>

A hash containing two elements: C<bugs> and C<attachments>. The return
value looks like this:

 {
     bugs => {
         1345 => {
             attachments => [
                 { (attachment) },
                 { (attachment) }
             ]
         },
         9874 => {
             attachments => [
                 { (attachment) },
                 { (attachment) }
             ]

         },
     },

     attachments => {
         234 => { (attachment) },
         123 => { (attachment) },
     }
 }

The attachments of any bugs that you specified in the C<ids> argument in
input are returned in C<bugs> on output. C<bugs> is a hash that has integer
bug IDs for keys and contains a single key, C<attachments>. That key points
to an arrayref that contains attachments as a hash. (Fields for attachments
are described below.)

For any attachments that you specified directly in C<attachment_ids>, they
are returned in C<attachments> on output. This is a hash where the attachment
ids point directly to hashes describing the individual attachment.

The fields for each attachment (where it says C<(attachment)> in the
diagram above) are:

=over

=item C<data>

C<base64> The raw data of the attachment, encoded as Base64.

=item C<creation_time>

C<dateTime> The time the attachment was created.

=item C<last_change_time>

C<dateTime> The last time the attachment was modified.

=item C<id>

C<int> The numeric id of the attachment.

=item C<bug_id>

C<int> The numeric id of the bug that the attachment is attached to.

=item C<file_name>

C<string> The file name of the attachment.

=item C<summary>

C<string> A short string describing the attachment.

Also returned as C<description>, for backwards-compatibility with older
Bugzillas. (However, this backwards-compatibility will go away in Bugzilla
5.0.)

=item C<content_type>

C<string> The MIME type of the attachment.

=item C<is_private>

C<boolean> True if the attachment is private (only visible to a certain
group called the "insidergroup"), False otherwise.

=item C<is_obsolete>

C<boolean> True if the attachment is obsolete, False otherwise.

=item C<is_url>

C<boolean> True if the attachment is a URL instead of actual data,
False otherwise. Note that such attachments only happen when the 
Bugzilla installation has at some point had the C<allow_attach_url>
parameter enabled.

=item C<is_patch>

C<boolean> True if the attachment is a patch, False otherwise.

=item C<creator>

C<string> The login name of the user that created the attachment.

Also returned as C<attacher>, for backwards-compatibility with older
Bugzillas. (However, this backwards-compatibility will go away in Bugzilla
5.0.)

=back

=item B<Errors>

This method can throw all the same errors as L</get>. In addition,
it can also throw the following error:

=over

=item 304 (Auth Failure, Attachment is Private)

You specified the id of a private attachment in the C<attachment_ids>
argument, and you are not in the "insider group" that can see
private attachments.

standard L<include_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/include_fields> and
L<exclude_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/exclude_fields> arguments.

=over

=item C<ids>

C<array> An array that can contain both bug IDs and bug aliases.
All of the comments (that are visible to you) will be returned for the
specified bugs.

=item C<comment_ids> 

C<array> An array of integer comment_ids. These comments will be
returned individually, separate from any other comments in their
respective bugs.

=item C<new_since>

C<dateTime> If specified, the method will only return comments I<newer>
than this time. This only affects comments returned from the C<ids>
argument. You will always be returned all comments you request in the
C<comment_ids> argument, even if they are older than this date.

=back

=item B<Returns>

Two items are returned:

=over

=item C<bugs>

This is used for bugs specified in C<ids>. This is a hash,
where the keys are the numeric ids of the bugs, and the value is
a hash with a single key, C<comments>, which is an array of comments.
(The format of comments is described below.)

Note that any individual bug will only be returned once, so if you
specify an id multiple times in C<ids>, it will still only be
returned once.

=item C<comments>

Each individual comment requested in C<comment_ids> is returned here,
in a hash where the numeric comment id is the key, and the value
is the comment. (The format of comments is described below.) 

=back

=item id

C<int> The globally unique ID for the comment.

=item bug_id

C<int> The ID of the bug that this comment is on.

=item attachment_id

=item text

C<string> The actual text of the comment.

=item creator

C<string> The login name of the comment's author.

Also returned as C<author>, for backwards-compatibility with older
Bugzillas. (However, this backwards-compatibility will go away in Bugzilla
5.0.)

=item time

C<dateTime> The time (in Bugzilla's timezone) that the comment was added.

=item is_private

C<boolean> True if this comment is private (only visible to a certain
group called the "insidergroup"), False otherwise.

=back

=item B<Errors>

This method can throw all the same errors as L</get>. In addition,
it can also throw the following errors:

=over

=item 110 (Comment Is Private)

argument, and you are not in the "insider group" that can see
private comments.

=item 111 (Invalid Comment ID)

You specified an id in the C<comment_ids> argument that is invalid--either
you specified something that wasn't a number, or there is no comment with
that id.

=back

=item B<History>

Note: Can also be called as "get_bugs" for compatibilty with Bugzilla 3.0 API.

=item B<Params>

In addition to the parameters below, this method also accepts the
standard L<include_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/include_fields> and
L<exclude_fields|Bugzilla::WebService/exclude_fields> arguments.

=over

=item C<ids>

An array of numbers and strings.

If an element in the array is entirely numeric, it represents a bug_id
from the Bugzilla database to fetch. If it contains any non-numeric 
characters, it is considered to be a bug alias instead, and the bug with 
that alias will be loaded. 

Note that it's possible for aliases to be disabled in Bugzilla, in which
case you will be told that you have specified an invalid bug_id if you
try to specify an alias. (It will be error 100.)

=item C<permissive> B<EXPERIMENTAL>

C<boolean> Normally, if you request any inaccessible or invalid bug ids,
Bug.get will throw an error. If this parameter is True, instead of throwing an
error we return an array of hashes with a C<id>, C<faultString> and C<faultCode> 
for each bug that fails, and return normal information for the other bugs that 
were accessible.

=back

An array of numbers and strings.

If an element in the array is entirely numeric, it represents a bug_id

=over

=item when

C<dateTime> The date the bug activity/change happened.

=item who

C<string> The login name of the user who performed the bug change.

=item field_name

C<string> The name of the bug field that has changed.

=item removed

C<string> The previous value of the bug field which has been deleted 
by the change.

=item added

C<string> The new value of the bug field which has been added by the change.

=item attachment_id

C<int> The id of the attachment that was changed. This only appears if

=head2 search

B<UNSTABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Allows you to search for bugs based on particular criteria.

=item B<Params>

Unless otherwise specified in the description of a parameter, bugs are
returned if they match I<exactly> the criteria you specify in these 
parameters. That is, we don't match against substrings--if a bug is in
the "Widgets" product and you ask for bugs in the "Widg" product, you
won't get anything.

Criteria are joined in a logical AND. That is, you will be returned
bugs that match I<all> of the criteria, not bugs that match I<any> of
the criteria.

Each parameter can be either the type it says, or an array of the types
it says. If you pass an array, it means "Give me bugs with I<any> of
these values." For example, if you wanted bugs that were in either
the "Foo" or "Bar" products, you'd pass:

 product => ['Foo', 'Bar']

Some Bugzillas may treat your arguments case-sensitively, depending
on what database system they are using. Most commonly, though, Bugzilla is 
not case-sensitive with the arguments passed (because MySQL is the 
most-common database to use with Bugzilla, and MySQL is not case sensitive).

=over

=item C<alias>

C<string> The unique alias for this bug. Note that you can search
by alias even if the alias field is disabled in this Bugzilla, but
it's likely that there won't be any aliases set on bugs, in that case.

=item C<assigned_to>

C<string> The login name of a user that a bug is assigned to.

=item C<component>

C<string> The name of the Component that the bug is in. Note that
if there are multiple Components with the same name, and you search
for that name, bugs in I<all> those Components will be returned. If you
don't want this, be sure to also specify the C<product> argument.

=item C<creation_time>

C<dateTime> Searches for bugs that were created at this time or later.
May not be an array.

=item C<creator>

C<string> The login name of the user who created the bug.

=item C<id>

C<int> The numeric id of the bug.

=item C<last_change_time>

C<dateTime> Searches for bugs that were modified at this time or later.
May not be an array.

=item C<limit>

C<int> Limit the number of results returned to C<int> records.

=item C<offset>

C<int> Used in conjunction with the C<limit> argument, C<offset> defines 
the starting position for the search. For example, given a search that 
would return 100 bugs, setting C<limit> to 10 and C<offset> to 10 would return 
bugs 11 through 20 from the set of 100.

=item C<op_sys>

C<string> The "Operating System" field of a bug.

=item C<platform>

C<string> The Platform (sometimes called "Hardware") field of a bug.

=item C<priority>

C<string> The Priority field on a bug.

=item C<product>

C<string> The name of the Product that the bug is in.

=item C<creator>

C<string> The login name of the user who reported the bug.

You can also pass this argument with the name C<reporter>, for
backwards compatibility with older Bugzillas.

=item C<resolution>

C<string> The current resolution--only set if a bug is closed. You can
find open bugs by searching for bugs with an empty resolution.

=item C<severity>

C<string> The Severity field on a bug.

=item C<status>

C<string> The current status of a bug (not including its resolution,
if it has one, which is a separate field above).

=item C<summary>

C<string> Searches for substrings in the single-line Summary field on
bugs. If you specify an array, then bugs whose summaries match I<any> of the
passed substrings will be returned.

Note that unlike searching in the Bugzilla UI, substrings are not split
on spaces. So searching for C<foo bar> will match "This is a foo bar"
but not "This foo is a bar". C<['foo', 'bar']>, would, however, match
the second item.

=item C<target_milestone>

C<string> The Target Milestone field of a bug. Note that even if this
Bugzilla does not have the Target Milestone field enabled, you can
still search for bugs by Target Milestone. However, it is likely that
in that case, most bugs will not have a Target Milestone set (it
defaults to "---" when the field isn't enabled).

=item C<qa_contact>

C<string> The login name of the bug's QA Contact. Note that even if
this Bugzilla does not have the QA Contact field enabled, you can
still search for bugs by QA Contact (though it is likely that no bug
will have a QA Contact set, if the field is disabled).

=item C<url>

C<string> The "URL" field of a bug.

=item C<version>

C<string> The Version field of a bug.

=item C<whiteboard>

C<string> Search the "Status Whiteboard" field on bugs for a substring.
Works the same as the C<summary> field described above, but searches the
Status Whiteboard field.

=back

=item B<Returns>

The same as L</get>.

Note that you will only be returned information about bugs that you
can see. Bugs that you can't see will be entirely excluded from the
results. So, if you want to see private bugs, you will have to first 
log in and I<then> call this method.

=item B<Errors>

Currently, this function doesn't throw any special errors (other than
the ones that all webservice functions can throw). If you specify
an invalid value for a particular field, you just won't get any results
for that value.

=item B<History>

=over

=item Added in Bugzilla B<3.4>.

=item Searching by C<votes> was removed in Bugzilla B<4.0>.

=item The C<reporter> input parameter was renamed to C<creator>
in Bugzilla B<4.0>.

=head1 Bug Creation and Modification

=head2 create

B<STABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

This allows you to create a new bug in Bugzilla. If you specify any
invalid fields, they will be ignored. If you specify any fields you
are not allowed to set, they will just be set to their defaults or ignored.

You cannot currently set all the items here that you can set on enter_bug.cgi.

The WebService interface may allow you to set things other than those listed
here, but realize that anything undocumented is B<UNSTABLE> and will very
likely change in the future.

=item B<Params>

Some params must be set, or an error will be thrown. These params are
marked B<Required>. 

Some parameters can have defaults set in Bugzilla, by the administrator.
If these parameters have defaults set, you can omit them. These parameters
are marked B<Defaulted>.

Clients that want to be able to interact uniformly with multiple
Bugzillas should always set both the params marked B<Required> and those 
marked B<Defaulted>, because some Bugzillas may not have defaults set
for B<Defaulted> parameters, and then this method will throw an error
if you don't specify them.

The descriptions of the parameters below are what they mean when Bugzilla is
being used to track software bugs. They may have other meanings in some
installations.

=over

=item C<product> (string) B<Required> - The name of the product the bug
is being filed against.

=item C<component> (string) B<Required> - The name of a component in the
product above.

=item C<summary> (string) B<Required> - A brief description of the bug being
filed.

=item C<version> (string) B<Required> - A version of the product above;
the version the bug was found in.

=item C<description> (string) B<Defaulted> - The initial description for 
this bug. Some Bugzilla installations require this to not be blank.

=item C<op_sys> (string) B<Defaulted> - The operating system the bug was
discovered on.

=item C<platform> (string) B<Defaulted> - What type of hardware the bug was
experienced on.

=item C<priority> (string) B<Defaulted> - What order the bug will be fixed
in by the developer, compared to the developer's other bugs.

=item C<severity> (string) B<Defaulted> - How severe the bug is.

=item C<alias> (string) - A brief alias for the bug that can be used 
instead of a bug number when accessing this bug. Must be unique in
all of this Bugzilla.

=item C<assigned_to> (username) - A user to assign this bug to, if you
don't want it to be assigned to the component owner.

=item C<cc> (array) - An array of usernames to CC on this bug.

=item C<comment_is_private> (boolean) - If set to true, the description
is private, otherwise it is assumed to be public.

=item C<groups> (array) - An array of group names to put this
bug into. You can see valid group names on the Permissions
tab of the Preferences screen, or, if you are an administrator,
in the Groups control panel.
If you don't specify this argument, then the bug will be added into
all the groups that are set as being "Default" for this product. (If
you want to avoid that, you should specify C<groups> as an empty array.)

=item C<qa_contact> (username) - If this installation has QA Contacts
enabled, you can set the QA Contact here if you don't want to use
the component's default QA Contact.

=item C<status> (string) - The status that this bug should start out as.
Note that only certain statuses can be set on bug creation.

=item C<target_milestone> (string) - A valid target milestone for this
product.

=back

In addition to the above parameters, if your installation has any custom
fields, you can set them just by passing in the name of the field and
its value as a string.

=item B<Returns>

A hash with one element, C<id>. This is the id of the newly-filed bug.

=item B<Errors>

=over

=item 51 (Invalid Object)

You specified a field value that is invalid. The error message will have
more details.

=item 103 (Invalid Alias)

The alias you specified is invalid for some reason. See the error message
for more details.

=item 104 (Invalid Field)

One of the drop-down fields has an invalid value, or a value entered in a
text field is too long. The error message will have more detail.

=item 105 (Invalid Component)

You didn't specify a component.

=item 106 (Invalid Product)

Either you didn't specify a product, this product doesn't exist, or
you don't have permission to enter bugs in this product.

=item 107 (Invalid Summary)

You didn't specify a summary for the bug.

=item 116 (Dependency Loop)

You specified values in the C<blocks> or C<depends_on> fields
that would cause a circular dependency between bugs.

=item 120 (Group Restriction Denied)

You tried to restrict the bug to a group which does not exist, or which
you cannot use with this product.

=item 504 (Invalid User)

Either the QA Contact, Assignee, or CC lists have some invalid user
in them. The error message will have more details.

=back

=item B<History>

=over

=item Before B<3.0.4>, parameters marked as B<Defaulted> were actually
B<Required>, due to a bug in Bugzilla.

=item The C<groups> argument was added in Bugzilla B<4.0>. Before
Bugzilla 4.0, bugs were only added into Mandatory groups by this
method. Since Bugzilla B<4.0.2>, passing an illegal group name will
throw an error. In Bugzilla 4.0 and 4.0.1, illegal group names were
silently ignored.

=item The C<comment_is_private> argument was added in Bugzilla B<4.0>.
Before Bugzilla 4.0, you had to use the undocumented C<commentprivacy>
argument.

=item Error 116 was added in Bugzilla B<4.0>. Before that, dependency
loop errors had a generic code of C<32000>.

=head2 update

B<UNSTABLE>

=over

=item B<Description>

Allows you to update the fields of a bug. Automatically sends emails
out about the changes.

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<ids>

Array of C<int>s or C<string>s. The ids or aliases of the bugs that
you want to modify.

=back

B<Note>: All following fields specify the values you want to set on the
bugs you are updating.

=over

=item C<alias>

(string) The alias of the bug. You can only set this if you are modifying 
a single bug. If there is more than one bug specified in C<ids>, passing in
a value for C<alias> will cause an error to be thrown.

=item C<assigned_to>

C<string> The full login name of the user this bug is assigned to.

=item C<blocks>

=item C<depends_on>

C<hash> These specify the bugs that this bug blocks or depends on,
respectively. To set these, you should pass a hash as the value. The hash
may contain the following fields:

=over

=item C<add> An array of C<int>s. Bug ids to add to this field.

=item C<remove> An array of C<int>s. Bug ids to remove from this field.
If the bug ids are not already in the field, they will be ignored.

=item C<set> An array of C<int>s. An exact set of bug ids to set this
field to, overriding the current value. If you specify C<set>, then C<add>
and  C<remove> will be ignored.

=back

=item C<cc>

C<hash> The users on the cc list. To modify this field, pass a hash, which
may have the following fields:

=over

=item C<add> Array of C<string>s. User names to add to the CC list.
They must be full user names, and an error will be thrown if you pass
in an invalid user name.

=item C<remove> Array of C<string>s. User names to remove from the CC
list. They must be full user names, and an error will be thrown if you
pass in an invalid user name.

=back

=item C<is_cc_accessible>

C<boolean> Whether or not users in the CC list are allowed to access
the bug, even if they aren't in a group that can normally access the bug.

=item C<comment>

C<hash>. A comment on the change. The hash may contain the following fields:

=over

=item C<body> C<string> The actual text of the comment.
B<Note>: For compatibility with the parameters to L</add_comment>,
you can also call this field C<comment>, if you want.

=item C<is_private> C<boolean> Whether the comment is private or not.
If you try to make a comment private and you don't have the permission
to, an error will be thrown.

=back

=item C<comment_is_private>

C<hash> This is how you update the privacy of comments that are already
on a bug. This is a hash, where the keys are the C<int> id of comments (not
their count on a bug, like #1, #2, #3, but their globally-unique id,
as returned by L</comments>) and the value is a C<boolean> which specifies
whether that comment should become private (C<true>) or public (C<false>).

The comment ids must be valid for the bug being updated. Thus, it is not
practical to use this while updating multiple bugs at once, as a single
comment id will never be valid on multiple bugs.

=item C<component>

C<string> The Component the bug is in.

=item C<deadline>

C<string> The Deadline field--a date specifying when the bug must
be completed by, in the format C<YYYY-MM-DD>.

=item C<dupe_of>

C<int> The bug that this bug is a duplicate of. If you want to mark
a bug as a duplicate, the safest thing to do is to set this value
and I<not> set the C<status> or C<resolution> fields. They will
automatically be set by Bugzilla to the appropriate values for
duplicate bugs.

=item C<estimated_time>

C<double> The total estimate of time required to fix the bug, in hours.
This is the I<total> estimate, not the amount of time remaining to fix it.

=item C<groups>

C<hash> The groups a bug is in. To modify this field, pass a hash, which
may have the following fields:

=over

=item C<add> Array of C<string>s. The names of groups to add. Passing
in an invalid group name or a group that you cannot add to this bug will
cause an error to be thrown.

=item C<remove> Array of C<string>s. The names of groups to remove. Passing
in an invalid group name or a group that you cannot remove from this bug
will cause an error to be thrown.

=back

=item C<keywords>

C<hash> Keywords on the bug. To modify this field, pass a hash, which
may have the following fields:

=over

=item C<add> An array of C<strings>s. The names of keywords to add to
the field on the bug. Passing something that isn't a valid keyword name
will cause an error to be thrown. 

=item C<remove> An array of C<string>s. The names of keywords to remove
from the field on the bug. Passing something that isn't a valid keyword
name will cause an error to be thrown.

=item C<set> An array of C<strings>s. An exact set of keywords to set the
field to, on the bug. Passing something that isn't a valid keyword name
will cause an error to be thrown. Specifying C<set> overrides C<add> and
C<remove>.

=back

=item C<op_sys>

C<string> The Operating System ("OS") field on the bug.

=item C<platform>

C<string> The Platform or "Hardware" field on the bug.

=item C<priority>

C<string> The Priority field on the bug.

=item C<product>

C<string> The name of the product that the bug is in. If you change
this, you will probably also want to change C<target_milestone>,
C<version>, and C<component>, since those have different legal
values in every product. 

If you cannot change the C<target_milestone> field, it will be reset to
the default for the product, when you move a bug to a new product.

You may also wish to add or remove groups, as which groups are
valid on a bug depends on the product. Groups that are not valid
in the new product will be automatically removed, and groups which
are mandatory in the new product will be automaticaly added, but no
other automatic group changes will be done.

Note that users can only move a bug into a product if they would
normally have permission to file new bugs in that product.

=item C<qa_contact>

C<string> The full login name of the bug's QA Contact.

=item C<is_creator_accessible>

C<boolean> Whether or not the bug's reporter is allowed to access
the bug, even if he or she isn't in a group that can normally access
the bug.

=item C<remaining_time>

C<double> How much work time is remaining to fix the bug, in hours.
If you set C<work_time> but don't explicitly set C<remaining_time>,
then the C<work_time> will be deducted from the bug's C<remaining_time>.

=item C<reset_assigned_to>

C<boolean> If true, the C<assigned_to> field will be reset to the
default for the component that the bug is in. (If you have set the
component at the same time as using this, then the component used
will be the new component, not the old one.)

=item C<reset_qa_contact>

C<boolean> If true, the C<qa_contact> field will be reset  to the
default for the component that the bug is in. (If you have set the
component at the same time as using this, then the component used
will be the new component, not the old one.)

=item C<resolution>

C<string> The current resolution. May only be set if you are closing
a bug or if you are modifying an already-closed bug. Attempting to set
the resolution to I<any> value (even an empty or null string) on an
open bug will cause an error to be thrown.

If you change the C<status> field to an open status, the resolution
field will automatically be cleared, so you don't have to clear it
manually.

=item C<see_also>

C<hash> The See Also field on a bug, specifying URLs to bugs in other
bug trackers. To modify this field, pass a hash, which may have the
following fields:

=over

=item C<add> An array of C<strings>s. URLs to add to the field.
Each URL must be a valid URL to a bug-tracker, or an error will
be thrown.

=item C<remove> An array of C<string>s. URLs to remove from the field.
Invalid URLs will be ignored.

=back

=item C<severity>

C<string> The Severity field of a bug.

=item C<status>

C<string> The status you want to change the bug to. Note that if
a bug is changing from open to closed, you should also specify
a C<resolution>.

=item C<summary>

C<string> The Summary field of the bug.

=item C<target_milestone>

C<string> The bug's Target Milestone.

=item C<url>

C<string> The "URL" field of a bug.

=item C<version>

C<string> The bug's Version field.

=item C<whiteboard>

C<string> The Status Whiteboard field of a bug.

=item C<work_time>

C<double> The number of hours worked on this bug as part of this change.
If you set C<work_time> but don't explicitly set C<remaining_time>,
then the C<work_time> will be deducted from the bug's C<remaining_time>.

=back

You can also set the value of any custom field by passing its name as
a parameter, and the value to set the field to. For multiple-selection
fields, the value should be an array of strings.

=item B<Returns>

A C<hash> with a single field, "bugs". This points to an array of hashes
with the following fields:

=over

=item C<id>

C<int> The id of the bug that was updated.

=item C<alias>

C<string> The alias of the bug that was updated, if aliases are enabled and
this bug has an alias.

=item C<last_change_time>

C<dateTime> The exact time that this update was done at, for this bug.
If no update was done (that is, no fields had their values changed and
no comment was added) then this will instead be the last time the bug
was updated.

=item C<changes>

C<hash> The changes that were actually done on this bug. The keys are
the names of the fields that were changed, and the values are a hash
with two keys:

=over

=item C<added> (C<string>) The values that were added to this field,
possibly a comma-and-space-separated list if multiple values were added.

=item C<removed> (C<string>) The values that were removed from this
field, possibly a comma-and-space-separated list if multiple values were
removed.

=back

=back

Here's an example of what a return value might look like:

 { 
   bugs => [
     {
       id    => 123,
       alias => 'foo',
       last_change_time => '2010-01-01T12:34:56',
       changes => {
         status => {
           removed => 'NEW',
           added   => 'ASSIGNED'
         },
         keywords => {
           removed => 'bar',
           added   => 'qux, quo, qui', 
         }
       },
     }
   ]
 }

Currently, some fields are not tracked in changes: C<comment>,
C<comment_is_private>, and C<work_time>. This means that they will not
show up in the return value even if they were successfully updated.
This may change in a future version of Bugzilla.

=item B<Errors>

This function can throw all of the errors that L</get>, L</create>,
and L</add_comment> can throw, plus:

=over

=item 50 (Empty Field)

You tried to set some field to be empty, but that field cannot be empty.
The error message will have more details.

=item 52 (Input Not A Number)

You tried to set a numeric field to a value that wasn't numeric.

=item 54 (Number Too Large)

You tried to set a numeric field to a value larger than that field can
accept.

=item 55 (Number Too Small)

You tried to set a negative value in a numeric field that does not accept
negative values.

=item 56 (Bad Date/Time)

You specified an invalid date or time in a date/time field (such as
the C<deadline> field or a custom date/time field).

=item 112 (See Also Invalid)

You attempted to add an invalid value to the C<see_also> field.

=item 115 (Permission Denied)

You don't have permission to change a particular field to a particular value.
The error message will have more detail.

=item 116 (Dependency Loop)

You specified a value in the C<blocks> or C<depends_on> fields that causes
a dependency loop.

=item 117 (Invalid Comment ID)

You specified a comment id in C<comment_is_private> that isn't on this bug.

=item 118 (Duplicate Loop)

You specified a value for C<dupe_of> that causes an infinite loop of
duplicates.

=item 119 (dupe_of Required)

You changed the resolution to C<DUPLICATE> but did not specify a value
for the C<dupe_of> field.

=item 120 (Group Add/Remove Denied)

You tried to add or remove a group that you don't have permission to modify
for this bug, or you tried to add a group that isn't valid in this product.

=item 121 (Resolution Required)

You tried to set the C<status> field to a closed status, but you didn't
specify a resolution.

=item 122 (Resolution On Open Status)

This bug has an open status, but you specified a value for the C<resolution>

=item 123 (Invalid Status Transition)

You tried to change from one status to another, but the status workflow
rules don't allow that change.

=head2 update_see_also

B<EXPERIMENTAL>

=over

=item B<Description>

Adds or removes URLs for the "See Also" field on bugs. These URLs must
point to some valid bug in some Bugzilla installation or in Launchpad.

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<ids>

Array of C<int>s or C<string>s. The ids or aliases of bugs that you want
to modify.

=item C<add>

Array of C<string>s. URLs to Bugzilla bugs. These URLs will be added to
the See Also field. They must be valid URLs to C<show_bug.cgi> in a
Bugzilla installation or to a bug filed at launchpad.net.

If the URLs don't start with C<http://> or C<https://>, it will be assumed
that C<http://> should be added to the beginning of the string.

It is safe to specify URLs that are already in the "See Also" field on
a bug--they will just be silently ignored.

=item C<remove>

Array of C<string>s. These URLs will be removed from the See Also field.
You must specify the full URL that you want removed. However, matching
is done case-insensitively, so you don't have to specify the URL in
exact case, if you don't want to.

If you specify a URL that is not in the See Also field of a particular bug,
it will just be silently ignored. Invaild URLs are currently silently ignored,
though this may change in some future version of Bugzilla.

=back

NOTE: If you specify the same URL in both C<add> and C<remove>, it will
be I<added>. (That is, C<add> overrides C<remove>.)

=item B<Returns>

C<changes>, a hash where the keys are numeric bug ids and the contents
are a hash with one key, C<see_also>. C<see_also> points to a hash, which
contains two keys, C<added> and C<removed>. These are arrays of strings,
representing the actual changes that were made to the bug.

Here's a diagram of what the return value looks like for updating
bug ids 1 and 2:

 {
   changes => {
       1 => {
           see_also => {
               added   => (an array of bug URLs),
               removed => (an array of bug URLs),
           }
       },
       2 => {
           see_also => {
               added   => (an array of bug URLs),
               removed => (an array of bug URLs),
