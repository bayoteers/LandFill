=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::WebService::Util - Utility functions used inside of the WebService
code. These are B<not> functions that can be called via the WebService.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is somewhat like L<Bugzilla::Util>, but these functions are only used
internally in the WebService code.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 filter({ include_fields => ['id', 'name'], 
          exclude_fields => ['name'] }, $hash);
 my $wants = filter_wants $params, 'field_name';
 validate(@_, 'ids');

=head1 METHODS

=head2 filter

This helps implement the C<include_fields> and C<exclude_fields> arguments
of WebService methods. Given a hash (the second argument to this subroutine),
this will remove any keys that are I<not> in C<include_fields> and then remove
any keys that I<are> in C<exclude_fields>.

=head2 filter_wants

Returns C<1> if a filter would preserve the specified field when passing
a hash to L</filter>, C<0> otherwise.

=head2 validate

This helps in the validation of parameters passed into the WebSerice
methods. Currently it converts listed parameters into an array reference
if the client only passed a single scalar value. It modifies the parameters
hash in place so other parameters should be unaltered.
