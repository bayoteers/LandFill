WARNING: This will convert the status of all bugs using the following
system:

  "NEW" will become "CONFIRMED"
  "ASSIGNED" will become "IN_PROGRESS"
  "REOPENED" will become "CONFIRMED" (and the "REOPENED" status will be removed)
  "CLOSED" will become "VERIFIED" (and the "CLOSED" status will be removed)

This change will be immediate. The history of each bug will also be changed
so that it appears that these statuses were always in existence.

Emails will not be sent for the change.

If you also want to enable the UNCONFIRMED status in every product,
restart this script with the --enable-unconfirmed option.

Done. There are some things you may want to fix, now:

  * You may want to run ./collectstats.pl --regenerate to regenerate
    data for the Old Charts system. 
  * You may have to fix the Status Workflow using the Status Workflow
    panel in "Administration".
  * You will probably want to update the "mybugstemplate" and "defaultquery"
    parameters using the Parameters panel in "Administration". (Just
    resetting them to the default will work.)
